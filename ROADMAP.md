## Questions

How does the genome reshape under oscillating conditions?

What are strategies to cope with two alternating, oscillating resources?

What, if any, is the fitness advantage in competition to no-clock organisms?

What, if any, is the fitness advantage in competition to different cycling organisms?

What are the boundary conditions that allow for the evolution of circadian clocks? Mutation rate, oscillation (length compared to organisms live cycle, length differences between phases, 12h/12h vs. 16h/8h etc.), reward differences, resources limitation...

Can the evolved clock adapt to new cyclic environments? No mutations allowed, put clock organisms into new phase world.

## Setup
### Sleep

A population of organisms in an environment where a resource is always available can be non-adaptive and function exceptionally well. There is little or no selective pressure on the organisms to adjust their behavior within this environment since resources are plentiful and can be consumed at any time. If resources often become diminished or unavailable, an adaptive response might allow for more conservative resource usage or increased energy storage. Natural organisms often display adaptive behavior that coincides with environmental changes where resources fluctuate. How could resource-aware adaptive behaviors, such as sleep and hibernation, have evolved in competitive environments where torpid organisms are vulnerable to active organisms? Is there a selective pressure to sleep caused by resource limitations in environments with periodic resource availability?
We have shown that populations of digital organisms are capable of evolving resource-aware adaptive sleep/wake behavior in an environment where resource availability is periodic and declines over time. The organisms in these populations become highly active when the resource is available and sleep when it is not. This behavior evolves even though sleeping organisms are vulnerable to non-sleepers and there exists a selective pressure not to sleep. This behavior evolved and remained stable in a majority of the populations in our experiments. We also have seen evidence suggesting that the adage “early to bed, early to rise” describes an evolved behavior, as organisms maximize their probability of being rewarded for completing tasks. This behavior evolved even in the presence of a selective pressure not to sleep.
