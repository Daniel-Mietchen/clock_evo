## Roadmap

### Research Questions

- How does the genome reshape under oscillating conditions?
- What are strategies to cope with two alternating, oscillating resources?
- What, if any, is the fitness advantage in competition to no-clock organisms?
- What, if any, is the fitness advantage in competition to different cycling organisms?
- What are the boundary conditions that allow for the evolution of circadian clocks? Mutation rate, oscillation (length compared to organisms live cycle, length differences between phases, 12h/12h vs. 16h/8h etc.), reward differences, resources limitation...
- Can the evolved clock adapt to new cyclic environments? No mutations allowed, put clock organisms into new phase world.

### Goals

1. Replicate [Beckmann et al., 2007]() and add second alternating resource cycle.
2. Create a pool of organisms with circadian clocks (adapted to different cycles).
3. Examine fitness in competition experiments with no-clock organisms and other clock organisms.
4. Find boundary condition taht allow for the evolution of circadian clocks (Mutation rate, different reward for resources)
