## Synthetic Microbiology Retreat

This week we hosted a lab retreat with some invited guests. I also gave a talk about my new project and some ideas and ways for open science. I tried something new by adding livestreaming my talk on YouTube. Normally I just post my slides on [SlideShare]() and try to schedule some tweets with the main points off my talk. This time I wanted to try to add a livestream of my talk by using Google Hangout and YouTube. This worked better than expected. The recording will remain on [YouTube](), but I will try to play around with some editing tools next week. However, the simplicity of livestreaming a talk or lecture makes it a great tool and should be used much more often. You only need a Wifi connection and a Google account to do it.
After my talk I had a great discussion with [Stefan Legewie](), one of our guests, about open science, preprints, and open data. I think I could convince him that preprints are a great way to get your work out there as soon as possible. I think that even some of his PhD students already mentioned preprints, which is even better as he has interested young students in his lab. One questions that I couldn't help with, since it was a little bit to specific. So I will post it here and later on twitter as well.

Where can he upload large amount of high resolution microscopy images? I first thought about [DataDryad](), but I'm not really sure.

Last week the organizers of the fellow program asked me to write a blogpost introducing my project to a broader audience. So after the retreat I set down to write a few words about my project.
