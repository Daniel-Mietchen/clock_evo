# Self-learning Computer Programs and Evolution

Computer play an increasing role in todays society. On the one hand we are actively using computer on a daily basis for various applications ranging from your alarm clock up to acquisition of new knowledge. On the other hand computers are controlling an increasing amount of tasks without our contribution. With an eye towards the future we will see that computers take over a large part of our work. A detailed examination of this topic was conducted in this year's ARD thematic week about "[Zukunft der Arbeit](http://www.ard.de/home/themenwoche/ARD_Themenwoche_2016_Zukunft_der_Arbeit/3234726/index.html)" (Future of work).

Thereby, a large proportion is the ability of computers to learn through information and data. Applications of this ability are found in different areas, i.e. the recommendation to buy something in an online shop or the usage in self-driving cars. In an era in which computers make data driven predictions, it should be possible to create new knowledge and solve problems using computers.

In my project I will therefore try to answer questions of evolution using small, autonomous computer programs. In detail, I will work on the evolution of time keeping mechanisms. Under what conditions can an "internal" clock evolve, anyway? Are those timing mechanisms beneficial for an organism? These are some questions I want to answer with the project.

## What are these "digital organisms"?

A problem that occurs when working on evolution is time. Normally, evolution happens extremely slowly. Luckily, there are only three conditions that needs to be fulfilled in order for evolution to occur:

* [__Replication__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction), so the ability to reproduce and produce offspring.
* [__Variation__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation), so the possibility of change over time and differences between individuals.
* [__Competition__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(biology)), so the fight for resources and the pressure to outcompete the competitor.

All of the requirements are met with these computer programs. Futhermore, computers have the advantage of speed and the convenience of data collection. This combination allows for a rapid investigation of evolutionary principles with large amounts of data.
Thus, in the center of my project are small, autonomous computer programs or "digital organisms". This is in fact a quite abstract construct. However, if you look more closely at these computer programs, you will that they are build onto similar principles as seen in [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria), for example. When I talk about digital organisms I refer to the organisms that are implemented in [Avida](http://www.ofria.com/pubs/2004OfriaEtAl.pdf), a platform for [computational evolution](https://youtu.be/ouF8wKxXWFQ).

Digital organisms, like normal organisms, have a genome, reproduce, and interact with their environment. The genome in Avida is comprised of a circular sequence of "instructions". Instructions can have various associated functions, e.g. the sensing of resources in the surrounding environment or the copying of the genome.
__Reproduction__ is in the most simplistic form __asexual__ by the __duplication of the genome__ and subsequent __division into two organisms__. Thus the first requirement for evolution is fulfilled.
During reproduction, as also seen in nature, __copy errors__ or the __deletion/insertion of genomic content__ can occur. These mutations cause the __variation__ between individual digital organisms and thus fulfill the second requirement for evolution.
As already mentioned, digital organisms can interact with there environment. These interactions can take several different forms depending on the question you try to answer. In most cases interactions are restricted to the uptake of resources from the environment. Resources, in Avida, are some kind of energy for digital organisms.
How is the third requirement for evolution, the competition between organisms, implemented in Avida? In the simplest form, digital organisms are fighting for space. There is only a limited amount of space in the Avida World and once all of it is occupied, newly born organisms replace other existing organisms. So it is a race for space to live. The only chance to ensure the survival of its species it to reproduce faster and more often. This opens up the second level of competition between, namely the competition for computer time. At the beginning every organism has the same time to perform instructions. All organisms are equally fast and reproduce at the same speed. The only way the get more computer time is to solve logic tasks, e.g. the organism gets to input numbers and needs to add them. A correct result will earn the organism a bonus. So the harder the performed task, the higher will the benefit be. This opens up the third level of competition. In summary, competition is described by the fight for living space, computer time, and complexity of tasks.

## When your interal clock gets out of balance

Everyone knows the phenomenon, when you have problems with waking up after changing the time, or when you come back from your vacation in a foreign country and you need to readapt to your normal timezone. The cause for this phenomenon is your "internal" clock or [circadian clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm). The circadian clock helps the body to adjust to reoccuring daily changes. A prominent example is, as described earlier, the day-night cycle. The "internal" clock is also a central component of the organization of cells and whole organisms. It can be found in almost all life forms [[10](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000062)]. Ranging from humans to other mammals such as mise to plants and ever simple unicellular organisms such as cyanobacteria. The question that arises is: what is the reason for such a clock? It could already exemplary been shown that a circadian clock provides a fitness advantage for its organism [[11](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8386795_The_adaptive_value_of_circadian_clocks_An_experimental_assessment_in_cyanobacteria)]. This advantage is, however, only visible under oscillating conditions, such as a day-night cycle.
How does a world had to look like that promoted the evolution of such a regulatory mechanism? The evolution of the first circadian clock goes billion of years back [[10](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000062)]. However, the differences between the known forms of circadian clocks are so large that multiple evolutions of these clocks are very likely [[10](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000062)].
In my project I want to try to answer these questions. I want to understand the influence of certain parameters on the evolution of circadian clocks, such as the length of day. Is it important that the length of day and night are constant and similar over the course of a year, similar to the equatorial zone, or can a clock evolve on a hemisphere with changing day lengths and seasons? As soon as I have a better understanding about the environmental conditions for the evolution of a circadian clock, I want to investigate how these clocks change the fitness of the organism in competition with other organisms. How beneficial are circadian clocks compared to organisms without a clock or even organisms with a differently adapted clock?

## Sideprojects

During the project two new sideprojects arose. While I was beginning with the project on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), a platform for collaborative working and [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) for programming projects, a couple of question arose regarding the correct setup of scientific project on GitHub. Which licence do I need, if any? What happens with my data and where do I store it? This let to a new project, which tries to build a guide of similar projects on GitHub.
In addition, I wanted to use [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) as a programming language for my data analysis. However, I needed some kind a reference collection in order to help other that want to participate in the project with the learning and using python.
Both of these projects are on GitHub as well and open for collaboration and help.
