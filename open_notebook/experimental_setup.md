### Experimental Setup

#### Sleep
A population of organisms in an environment where a resource is always available can be 
non-adaptive and function exceptionally well. There is little or no selective pressure on the 
organisms to adjust their behavior within this environment since resources are plentiful and can 
be consumed at any time. If resources often become diminished or unavailable, an adaptive response 
might allow for more conservative resource usage or increased energy storage. Natural organisms 
often display adaptive behavior that coincides with environmental changes where resources fluctuate. 
How could resource-aware adaptive behaviors, such as sleep and hibernation, have evolved in 
competitive environments where torpid organisms are vulnerable to active organisms? Is there a 
selective pressure to sleep caused by resource limitations in environments with periodic resource availability?
We have shown that populations of digital organisms are capable of evolving resource-aware adaptive 
sleep/wake behavior in an environment where resource availability is periodic and declines over time. 
The organisms in these populations become highly active when the resource is available and sleep when 
it is not. This behavior evolves even though sleeping organisms are vulnerable to non-sleepers and 
there exists a selective pressure not to sleep. This behavior evolved and remained stable in a 
majority of the populations in our experiments. We also have seen evidence suggesting that the 
adage “early to bed, early to rise” describes an evolved behavior, as organisms maximize their 
probability of being rewarded for completing tasks. This behavior evolved even in the presence 
of a selective pressure not to sleep.
