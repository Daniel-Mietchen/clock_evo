## Skype with Arend

On wednesday I had a skype meeting with [Arend Hintze]() an associate professor at [MSU](). Arend is also working on the evolution of timing, rhythms and the adaptation to changes in the timing behavior of organisms. One example are the changes of brain morphology and metabolism when organisms switch from a nocturnal to a diurnal lifestyle. To answer such questions he uses so called ['Markov Brains'](http://adamilab.msu.edu/markov-network-brains/), which are, if I understood correctly, some kind of artificial neural network. Arend is also helping me with my project and will host me in January/February next year.
I explained some of my ideas to Arend and we talked about next steps for the project. We decided that Avida would be best to start with, as originally planned, and then try to reproduce the results using Markov Brains. But we formulate a set of steps that needs to be answered prior to starting with the real project:

1. Reproduce the work of Beckmann et al.
  * I already contacted Charles Ofria to get the code to reproduce their results.
2. Create a detailed experimental design.
  * This is important the figure out if Markov Brains can acutally be used.
3. Skype meeting to talk about results and experimental design and discuss next steps.

## Google Digital Workshop

This week I attended a [digital workshop]() by Google. This workshop was mainly about online marketing, but had still a lot of interesting stuff for me. Understanding how marketing works and especially identifing the right channels to reach your peers is also important in science. Social media will become more and more important as a tool for personal branding even in science. I think that social media should also be used much more by scientist to communicate their findings to a broader audience. In the following I will elucidate two ideas that I will try to implement in the future.

### YouTube

The way students learn today has a strong focus on video material. However, this has not yet reached the universities and research institutions to the extent that it is used by students. One example that came to my mind when I we were surveyed about our use of videos in learning. Usually when I send around a new paper or something interesting to read in the lab, people are reluctant to engage with the material. However, when I send around a YouTube link almost all of our lab members watched the video within an hour.    
Producing a video or a screencast is much more work than writing a short article, but the engagement with the material is worth the effort. Thus, I will try to produce a couple of videos and tutorials for this project in the next weeks.    
There is, however, a way to produce a video on the fly by screencasting or live stream your talks and lectures.

### Google Presentation & Live Stream

Some conferences today already record or stream their talks, but if this is not the case it is easy to just take care of it yourself. [Google Hangout]() and YouTube allow you to livestream your talk or screen and is easy to set up. I will try this myself for my next talk on Tuesday.
Something else I learn during the workshop. Google now features an audience question tool for presentations. This is really useful, because it allows the audience to ask questions and you can react and answer them when there is time. Furthermore, people that don't have the courage to ask a 'stupid' question in front of a large audience can now anonymously ask their questions.    
I think that both tools are great to engage with the audience.
