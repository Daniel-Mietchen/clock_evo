## Screencasts on YouTube

I used this week to finally produce some screencasts for tutorials and uploaded them to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9c2TOIhMFmH1tU9fhlzP2A).

Created video:

* [How to livestream your presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPLAnMqk4YA)
* [How to schedule tweets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsSOSUtd_zs)
* [How to install Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XiAFoFSoy4)

The first two videos show a way for opening up your talk to people who can not attend your presentation. The last video helps you to install Python through anaconda/miniconda distribution on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

I thing the results of the screencasts are good for the moment, however, making a great screencast requires a lot of preparation, some additional equipment other than a laptop, and some design experiences. I want to learn more about making video tutorials, because I think they are a great learning tool and are quite fun to make.

## Copyrights

On YouTube you have two choises for publishing a video:

* YouTube standard license (I only found the [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=de&template=terms&hl=de), but I didn't really looked)
* [Creative Commons Attributions 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode)

I published the videos under the CC BY license, because I thought this would allow for reuse of the content. Daniel pointed out to me that it is not that easy to put a license on your video. You could have content in your video that is licensed under a different license and you're not allowed to license otherwise. This could be website content, icons, or even the browser you are using. I haven't really thought about that and find it kind of scary that you have to think about so many things. I wonder how YouTube is dealing with this problem in their license?! If there is a guide or something similar that addresses this problem in detail please point me to it. Daniel showed me the [Wikimedia CC license pamphlet](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_Deutschland/Brosch√ºre_CC-Lizenzen).
