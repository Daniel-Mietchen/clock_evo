# Data Management Plan

### Background

This Data Management Plan was created for the clock evolution project funded by Wikimedia and Stifterverband. It describes the management and sharing of all data and code.

## Data Description

The majority of the data involved in this project will be new data generated in the project. This data will typically be tabular data and will be stored in standard data formats. Metadata will be provided for all data products.

## Data Management

During development the data, software, and associated metadata that we produce will be stored on GitHub. Data and software access and distribution will be managed using Git and the centralized Git host. Following development data and software will be archived in more permanent locations (see Data Sharing).

## Data Sharing

Data and software will be developed in the open, with new data and changes to software being made public (typically via GitHub) in near-real-time. At the end of the project the data will be archived in a long-term repository that includes meaningful assurances that the archive will be available even if the repository shuts down. Documentation, tutorials, and metadata for using both data and software will be archived with the relevant product. Examples of data and software repositories we will use include Dryad, Figshare. The original software and data sources will also be maintained on the Git-repository host to facilitate further development. The goal of these combined efforts is to maintain archives of all data and software products indefinitely. By using centralized archives hardware maintainence is not required.

All data will be published using the CC0 Public Domain Dedication if allowed by the repository, with CC-BY as a fallback if the repository does not allow CC0.

In cases where we compile data from other sources we will cite all of the relevant sources and, where appropriate based on substantial contributions, include original data collectors as authors on relevant data products.
