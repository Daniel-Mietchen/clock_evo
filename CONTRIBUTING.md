### How to contribute

The preferred workflow for contributing to this project is to fork the main repository on GitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:

Fork the project repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.

Clone your fork of the clock_evo repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/clock_evo.git
$ cd clock_evo
```
Add changed files using git add and then git commit files:
```bash
$ git add modified_files
$ git commit
```
to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:
```bash
$ git push origin master
```
Go to the GitHub web page of your fork of the clock_evo repo. Click the 'Pull request' button to send your changes to the project's maintainers for review. This will send an email to the committers.

(For more information about Git, please look up the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) or check out the [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).)

### Pull Requests

If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is created.

### Filing Issues/Bugs

I use Github issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented. Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other issues or pull requests.

### New contributor tips

A great way to start contributing to clock_evo is to pick an item from the list of *easy* issues in the issue tracker. Resolving these issues allow you to start contributing to the project without much prior knowledge.
